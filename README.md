# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to provide an eficient means of analyzing stock data for clients. Due to the enormouse amounts of data to be analyzed refactoring code is necessary to provide timely informatin to clients. A comparison of the original code runtime and the modifed or refactored code will be made and results provided along with both sets of code. 

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
### Original analysis
The green stock analsyis xlsm file (green_stocks.xlsm), Module2_VBA_Script.rtf file, screen shot for runtime and anlaysis for 2017(Module2_2017_Runtime.png), and 2018 (Module2_2018_Runtime.png) are in the resource folder. The run time for 2017 was 0.429 seconds and for 2018 was 0.421. 
### Refactred Code and Analsysis
The VBA_Challange xlsm file (VBA_Challange.xlsm), VBA_Challange_Script.rtf file, screen shot for runtime and anlaysis for 2017(Challange_2017_Runtime.png), and 2018 (Challange_2018_Runtime.png) are in the resource folder. The run time for 2017 was 0.0507 seconds and for 2018 was 0.0546. 

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Obviously, refactoring the code made the runtime much shorter. The disadvantage was the the code was a little more complicated to write. If you are working with extremely large data sets then the faster runtime may be a benefit. On the other hand, the time to write refactored code may take more time than what you are saving in the runtime. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
In this particular example it took me a couple of hours to figure out how to refactor the code. The time saved on runtime was factions of seconds. In this particular case it wasn't necessary.
